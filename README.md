Web-Spider and SQLi Checker :~

It is a Single Targeted Website Crawler and SQLi checker. Actually I didn't get the time 
to combine both script and make it in one form. So i posted both script. Simple but Good 
and effective output. Will not hang on large website. Just run and wait untill it will not
finish.

How to use?

First you need to run "Spider_Only.py". It will crawl the website and save result in 
'Crawl_Result.txt' file in the current directory. Then you need to run "SQLi_Checker.py". 
It will open crawl result from 'Crawl_Result.txt' file and check for SQLi possibility one by one.
If SQLi has been found then it will save the result in 'SQLi_Result.txt' file into the current directory.
